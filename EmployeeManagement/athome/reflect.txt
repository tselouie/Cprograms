1) In two or three sentences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related data.

The advantages of using an array of structs as opposed to parallel arrays are that structs can align aspects of an object without making the code too difficult. Whereas
having parallel arrays would involve a less structured way of presenting data and may be very hectic when there are many different parts to an object.

2) The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why.
To have struct data in a header file allows for ease of access if you were to use this header across multiple .c files. Instead of inserting the 
struct declaration in each file you can just refer it to the header file.
