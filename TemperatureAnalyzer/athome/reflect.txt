1)The 3 iteration constructs are 'while', 'do while' and 'for'.

2)The difference between while and do while is that do while has to 
run through the iteration once and then test the condition whereas while 
will test the conditions first.

3)A conditional expression means an expression that has to be met in order
for the code to run or the code to continue to loop. Once those conditions are
not met the code will stop. For example when a<5 produce a code if not then 
the program will not proceed.
