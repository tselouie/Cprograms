1) In one or two sentences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?

The array has to hold 10 elements because it requires 4 values from high and 4 values from low and each of the variables requires a null terminator which equates to 10.

2) In two or three sentences explain the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?

An advantage of having matching arrays is that you can assign different numbers to the arrays and refer back to them. However, a downfall is that the code is restricted 
in a sense that if you have used matching arrays it is difficult to change the semantics of the code.


3) Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why?

It was just right because it uses aspects of what we learned and allowed us to implement it in the new code. The fact that it uses our brain a little but at the same time
it is not to the point where I have no clue what to do.
