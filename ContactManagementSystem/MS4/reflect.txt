3. findContextIndex allows the program easily to match the right user and getTenDigitPhone makes it so 
that if an incorrect number of digits are entered an easy failsafe is to be implemented without rewriting code.
All you have to do in order to ask for an input after it was incorrectly entered was is to call the 'getTenDigitPhone
function.

4.The importance of having lots of cohesion and very little coupling in the function. To have these aspects while creating your functions
makes for very modular and high reusability code.
