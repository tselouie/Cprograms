1-	What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?

	The most important thing I learned int his workshop is the use of casting and remainder.
	I had learned that the division modulus only works with integer numbers and not floats
	and as well I did not know that you could have it displayed as a float by entering a certain
	syntax in the print statement.

2-	Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?

	Adding .005 rounds the number up to the 13 which allows the calculations to become more accurate.

3-	What is the result of a casting operation?

	The casting operation allows you to change the type of number the variable is for a certain statement.
	By having the option of using casting you are able to use floats and integers interchangeably.

4-	Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?

	Although there are easier ways to complete the task using the modulus operator requires
	us to think differently and utilize more functions within the C code. This enables us to
	learn from something we have absolutely no experience with. I did have a very tough time
	with this lab because the concept seems to be difficult to apply.
